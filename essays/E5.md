# BrowserHistory 1:
For the first WoD, things went pretty smoothly and I was able to get through the majority of the exercise thanks to my previous experience with HTML from Dreamweaver and ICS101. I spent most of my time in the WoD trying to format my code to be readable and getting links.  Near the end I did end up running into issues involving linking my itemized list since I did not remember how to use links to link to different parts of the same HTML page (I had only used links for external files or URL's before).  Luckily however, I always make sure to keep a page open to w3schools whenever I work as although I may know how something is formated, I may not always remember the specific code/codeword to make something work; theres a lot of different tags and bits to HTML, and you can't always remember them all, so having a site like w3schools available while your working is handy for the occasional reference! Although the HTML worked, I did end up checking the screencast before ending my time to make sure my linking was right. This let me finish the WoD within Av time with 19 minutes on my first attempt.
 
# BrowserHistory 2:
The second WoD had a similar situation to the first WoD, and may have been a bit easier since it was much shorter with its focus on CSS, plus CSS isn't too hard. I did end up DNFing however pretty quickly as I could not figure out how to specify the text font-family to be Open Sans or get my images to be inline with my text. Normally for getting things inline, I would use code like display:inline but that code only works specifically for text from what I can tell and didn't work for the browser icons. For font-family's, I've only ever used a lot of the built-in families. After scratching my head for awhile it turned out that after watching the screencast we needed to use a special Google font API style.  Plus for making the images inline, the screencast helped by noting the use of float, which was a command I had not heard of before. After finding these things out it made my second attempt at the WoD go by really fast, and I ended my second attempt in just about 6 minutes.

# BrowserHistory 3:
This WoD I had the most trouble on, as although it was really short, I had never made columns in HTML before. I had experience splitting up content into smallers div's before which made things smoother, and I was able to figure out a way to split my div's into 3 columns but ended up spending the remainder of my first attempt trying to get my webpage to look like the completed image; my text wasn't split between each column by the paragraph, but instead wrapped like it would when in columns inside a normal Word document; there wasn't a clear way to create something akin to a column-break in word to force paragraphs to a specific column.  Because of this I DNF'd on my first attempt. I feel like this WoD would have been a good chance to start by first watching the screencast, then attempting the exercise (which is something I would recommend in the future!) as the screencast ended up using a lot of weird, new code and familiar code used in new ways that I did not consider which was interesting! It took awhile to wrap my head around the webpage not actually using columns but instead used CSS to float everything a specific way, but it was a good learning experience. From just remembering to use float, I was able to finish my second attempt in 5 minutes Rx time.
