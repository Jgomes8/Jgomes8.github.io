Hello! My name is Joseph Gomes, or Joey for short, and I am a third year undergraduate student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I am currently pursuing an BBA in Management Information Systems from the Shidler College of Business. I am 22 years and currently work here on campus as a Teaching Assistant for ICS 101. It's great to meet you!

Although I was initially undeclared for my first few years of college, I have decided on pursuing a degree in MIS.  This choice was recommend to me by advisors, professors, and co-workers as although I was interested in pursuing a degree that was involved with and used technology in many careers, I was hesitant to pursue similar degrees that were more technical such as in a Computer Science (CS) degree. Although I have dabbled a bit with programming in high school and have tried a programming course here at the university, it is definitely not my strong suit, especially compared to some of my friends. MIS with its blending of tech and business seemed like a good fit because of this.

Many of my friends and co-workers have also pursued degrees in MIS. I am currently taking this ITM course with a friend at the suggestion of a different, recently graduated co-worker. I look forward to what comes next in the coming semester!
