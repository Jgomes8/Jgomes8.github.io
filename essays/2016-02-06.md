Hello! My name is Joseph Gomes, or Joey for short, and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I am currently pursuing an BBA in Management Information Systems from the Shidler College of Business.

Although I was initially undeclared for my first few years of college, I have decided on pursuing a degree in MIS.  This choice was recommend to me by advisors, professors, and co-workers as although I was interested in pursuing a degree that was involved with and used technology in many careers, I was hesitant to pursue similar degrees that were more technical such as in a Computer Science (CS) degree. MIS with its duel focus of tech and business seemed like a good fit.

Many of my friends and co-workers have also pursued degrees in MIS. I am currently taking this course with a friend at the suggestion of a different, recently graduated friend. I look forward to what comes next in the coming semester!
